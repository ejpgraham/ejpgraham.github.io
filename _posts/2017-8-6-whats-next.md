title: What's it like to continue coding after flunking out of an in-person bootcamp?

Would I recommend App Academy? I would probably say yes, depending on what kind of person you are. The program requires three months of your undivided attention, and even without initial tuition payment, a large amount of financial resources to stay in NYC, eat in NYC, and commute in NYC (they also have a San Francisco school - another expensive place to learn). A paying job is not an option during this time, meaning you need savings or someone to help you out financially. It's a good option if you have a working partner or a family that's willing to help you attend a program like this.

Ultimately it wasn't for me (obviously). I found the assessments to be unbearably stressful and anxiety-provoking. The 10-14 hour days were grueling, exhausting, and demoralizing. Some people seemed used to the stress or even thrived on it, but I certainly did not. A nasty cold went around the office, and the staff only instituted a sensible sanitation regime only after it was too late. I got sick and remained sick for nearly two weeks, and I didn't take more than one sick day for fear of falling behind. The stress and lack of sleep kept me feeling unwell.

I was also still recovering from a broken leg, and unfortunately didn't allow myself enough time to heal before attempting such a grueling experience. App Academy would have likely delayed my enrollment and given me some time if I asked, but at the start of the course I felt well enough to get started. That was certainly not the only reason I flunked, but it did contribute. Lesson learned! 

Bloc takes a lot longer - nearly twice as many calendar days, but there are some nice advantages. The increased free time lets me pursue material that's fun or interesting, and I don't have to worry about sticking to material that's on the assessments. I can hold a job as I study, and focus on getting exercise and eating well. I get to spend time with my husband and actually eat meals with him. Bloc allows you to "freeze" the program for a few weeks, so I can take a real vacation. I can work just about anywhere that has an internet connection and a power outlet. Though they don't have the same overall tuition model as App Academy, Bloc costs about half as much as an in-person bootcamp.
