title: What's it like to attend an in-person bootcamp?
---

I attended App Academy, a demanding in-person web development bootcamp in New York City and I failed out of it! The program is a roughly three month course that requires long days, long weeks, and long months of coding. I'd like to talk a bit about my experience there: what I liked, what I didn't, why I flunked out, and whether, if I had the choice, I would go back and do it all over again.

Firstly - what I liked. I learned a ton. Your cohort is made entirely of people that are interested in coding, and you work side-by-side with highly motivated, intelligent people. The sheer volume of information thrown at you on a daily basis is like learning a language by immersion. You think about code so much you end up dreaming about it. Each day you pair-program with someone different, giving you a fresh perspective on the day's material.

The staff are very intelligent and are readily available to help if you get stuck during the daily projects. They are almost exclusively recruited from previous App Academy cohorts, specifically the best and brightest students. So not only are they knowledgable, they've been through everything you're going through. The curriculum is well-developed and honed, and contains a dizzying amount of information. It really is everything you need to get started on your path to becoming a coder.

While flunking out was an unpleasant experience, App Academy does refund your deposit and you do not have to pay any tuition. Additionally, you still have access to the curriculum, an invaluable tool should you continue your coding education, which I did with Bloc. I never had access to the job-hunting resources, but they seemed pretty robust. App Academy won't find a job for you, but they'll give you the tools and research to help you out.

Finally, I just enjoyed the people I coded with. The vast majority of the people I pair programmed with were pleasant and fun to work with. The instructors were friendly and seemed to know just about everything. App Academy does talk about diversity and trying to be sensitive towards racial minorities and women coders who are underrepresented in the tech world. There was a serious gender imbalance anyway, but it was good to see that the problem was being acknowledged. As a gay man, it felt like the entire cohort was on the same page as to treating each other with respect.

As far as bootcamps go, App Academy is the real deal. Other than a deposit of a few thousand dollars, you do not pay the tuition (usually around 15 grand total) until you get a job in web development. However, App Academy jealous guards its investment, which leads me to some parts of the program I didn't like: mainly me flunking out, which I'll talk about in my next post.
