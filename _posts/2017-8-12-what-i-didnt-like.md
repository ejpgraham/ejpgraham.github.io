title: What's it like to flunk out of an in-person bootcamp?

App Academy maintains staggering employment figures, usually around 98% of graduates getting a coding job within 3 or so months. This is not an untrue metric, but it conceals some of the brutal calculus necessary to maintain this figure. App Academy administers assessments to make sure you're learning the curriculum, and if you fail too many of them (2, with one chance at a retake) you are asked to leave the course. The assessments are used to weed out what App Academy views as the weakest students, ie. those that won't get jobs and muck up those nice figures.

As a result, App Academy is not shy about asking students to leave. During my time there about 15-20% of the students were dismissed (I can't recall the exact number). I am not sure if this was a higher number than normal. I was not a huge fan of this process even before it happened to me. A staff member calls you to a side office and explains that you're going home, you're getting your deposit back, we're so sorry, etc. etc.

The entire cohort can see that you've been called, and it was generally very clear that people were being dismissed. You were then dismissed and essentially not mentioned by the staff again. The App Academy home page displays a headshot of every student - dismissed students are unceremoniously removed.

This happened to some people I really liked and it was quite upsetting to see my friends being dismissed. By the end of my time in the program I was exhausted from the grueling days and not grasping the material. I failed an early assessment by one point, which left me vulnerable to dismissal early on and made the following assessments a truly nerve-wracking and miserable experience. When I was asked to leave I was extremely upset.

It felt in some ways that the previous two months of work had been for nothing. This certainly wasn't the case - I learned a huge amount about coding even if I didn't make it until the end of the course. I was probably one of the last people in my cohort to flunk out. It was frustrating to be relatively close to the end and not make it. But I quickly realized App Academy was just one step on my path to becoming a coder. I'll talk about what I did next in my next post.
